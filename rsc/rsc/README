The rsc package provides BibTeX style files to produce
bibliographies in accordance with the guidelines of the Royal
Society of Chemistry and Wiley chemistry-related journals. The
styles require the use of natbib.  In addition, a short LaTeX
package is included; this provides a convenient user interface to
the customisation hooks made available by the BibTeX styles.
